      question: 'What is your educational background?',
      answer:
        "I hold an Associate of Science in Computer Science from Tarrant County College, where I graduated with a 3.8 GPA. My academic foundation provided me with a strong understanding of the core principles of computer science, including programming, algorithms, and system design. What truly sets me apart, though, is my hands-on experience and continuous self-education in the field. Over the years, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering technologies and tools through real-world projects, certifications, and self-paced learning. I’ve built production-grade software that requires minimal maintenance, mentored developers, and even led teams to deliver high-quality apps that exceeded expectations. In addition, I earned my FAA Private Pilot's License (VFR/IFR) from Rose State College in 2009, which not only demonstrates my commitment to mastering technical and challenging skills but also highlights my ability to stay calm under pressure, focus on detail, and make critical decisions—traits I bring to my software development work. While I don’t hold a 4-year degree, I believe my combined academic background, self-taught expertise, and years of practical experience have uniquely equipped me to contribute meaningfully to your team.",
