    "developer_guidelines": [
      "Master the basics before chasing trends: Strong fundamentals make learning new technologies easier and more meaningful.",
      "Write code for humans, not just machines: Prioritize readability and maintainability in your code. Comment only where necessary but make your logic self-explanatory.",
      "Plan before you code: Spend time understanding the problem and designing the solution. Clear thinking upfront saves debugging time later.",
      "Automate repetitive tasks: If you do it twice, script it. Your future self will thank you.",
      "Adopt a consistent workflow: Use tools like Git effectively and stick to a clear commit structure and branching strategy.",
      "Focus on one task at a time: Multitasking kills productivity and leads to errors. Use methods like Pomodoro or time-blocking to maintain focus.",
      "Keep learning, but don’t overconsume: Balance learning new frameworks and tools with actually building and shipping projects.",
      "Test your code early and often: Embrace testing—unit tests, integration tests, and user testing—to prevent small bugs from becoming big problems.",
      "Refactor regularly: Avoid 'perfect' code from the start. Write functional code first and improve it iteratively.",
      "Adopt naming conventions: Good names in variables, methods, and classes make the codebase intuitive for others and for you months later.",
      "Learn to say no: Decline unnecessary meetings, avoid over-engineering, and push back on unrealistic deadlines.",
      "Respect deadlines but don’t sacrifice quality: Deliver working software on time, but not at the expense of technical debt or poor practices.",
      "Take breaks: Step away from your screen regularly to avoid burnout and maintain mental clarity.",
      "Stay curious but focused: Experiment with new tools, but don’t jump onto every shiny new thing—evaluate its relevance to your work.",
      "Document as you go: Maintain concise, up-to-date documentation for your projects to save time for yourself and others.",
      "Pair program or code review frequently: Collaboration strengthens code quality and helps you learn from others.",
      "Own your bugs: Debugging is a learning opportunity. Always investigate what went wrong and why.",
      "Set daily goals: Start each day with clear objectives and a prioritized list of tasks.",
      "Create an ergonomic workspace: Invest in a comfortable chair, an adjustable desk, and proper lighting for long coding sessions.",
      "Adopt version control discipline: Commit early, commit often, and never commit broken code to the main branch.",
      "Focus on impact, not lines of code: The best code is clean, concise, and does its job effectively.",
      "Contribute to open source or teach others: Sharing knowledge sharpens your skills and gives back to the community.",
      "Take care of your body and mind: Regular exercise, healthy eating, and mindfulness will improve your focus and creativity.",
      "Accept feedback gracefully: Learn from code reviews and critiques. They’re about the code, not you.",
      "Know when to walk away: If a solution isn’t working, step back, take a break, and approach it with fresh eyes.",
      "Use the right tool for the job: Don't overcomplicate by forcing a tool or language into a scenario where it doesn’t fit.",
      "Stay updated, but avoid FOMO: Learn about new trends and technologies, but only adopt what genuinely benefits your projects.",
      "Avoid premature optimization: Write functional code first; optimize only when necessary for performance or scalability.",
      "Protect your deep work time: Turn off notifications and create uninterrupted blocks of time for coding.",
      "Celebrate small wins: Acknowledge progress, no matter how small—it keeps motivation high. A software launch is not the time to celebrate though."
