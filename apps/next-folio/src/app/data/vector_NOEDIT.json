As a co-founder alongside two colleagues from SUCCESS Partners, I helped establish JOMA Tech to address the limitations of the eCommerce tools available at the time. We provided clients with speed, control, and beautiful designs by creating tools that served their unique needs while maintaining individuality across sites. One of our flagship innovations was Meteorite CMS, a headless solution that overcame the limitations of the BigCommerce API by syncing datasets to a Postgres SQL database with webhooks for real-time updates. This allowed us to query and join datasets, automate workflows, and enable non-commerce features like theming and page control. Meteorite not only gave developers the freedom to build any feature but also provided unparalleled SEO capabilities, with several of our sites still performing exceptionally today. In addition to my work at JOMA Tech, I also led groundbreaking projects at SUCCESS Partners and Fornida. At SUCCESS Partners, I created a monorepo architecture to support 25 Magento sites, consolidating 90% of business logic into a single codebase. This streamlined development, allowing new sites to be launched with minimal effort by simply adding a theme and deployment configuration.
